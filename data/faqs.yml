    question: "What is Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT)"
    answer: "<p>The aim of AHSCT is to ‘reset’ the immune system to stop it from attacking the central nervous system. Haematopoietic stem cells are not the type of stem cells that would be expected to change into or regenerate permanently damaged nerves or other parts of the brain and spinal cord.</p> <p>The Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation treatment uses high doses of chemotherapy and antibody treatments, and therefore is more intensive and higher risk than most other MS treatments and involves a number of steps:</p><ol><li>Collection or ‘harvesting’ of stem cells from the bone marrow or blood of the person receiving treatment</li><li>Purification and freezing of the harvested stem cells until they are required</li><li>Administration of chemotherapy to wipe out an individual’s white blood cells </li><li>Infusion of the thawed stem cells to help ‘reset’ the immune system</li></ol><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a type of adult stem cell made in the bone marrow, which have the ability to produce the different cells found in the blood. Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) is being investigated as a treatment for severe immune mediated diseases, including MS. The aim is to remove the harmful immune cells that attack the brain and spinal cord, and then re-boot the immune system using a person’s own (autologous) stem cells.</p><p>Typically, the person receiving a transplant will be closely observed for about a month in an isolation room whilst receiving antibiotics and transfusions to support them through the procedure. Prior to any treatment decisions being made, our specialist Consultant Haematologists and Neurologists will carefully assess the general health of the person receiving treatment and their ability to tolerate this type of treatment."
