    question: "What is Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT)?"
    answer: "<p>The aim of AHSCT is to ‘reset’ the immune system to stop it from attacking the central nervous system. Haematopoietic stem cells are not the type of stem cells that would be expected to change into or regenerate permanently damaged nerves or other parts of the brain and spinal cord.</p> <p>The Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation treatment uses high doses of chemotherapy and antibody treatments, and therefore is more intensive and higher risk than most other MS treatments and involves a number of steps:</p><ol><li>Collection or ‘harvesting’ of stem cells from the bone marrow or blood of the person receiving treatment</li><li>Purification and freezing of the harvested stem cells until they are required</li><li>Administration of chemotherapy to wipe out an individual’s white blood cells </li><li>Infusion of the thawed stem cells to help ‘reset’ the immune system</li></ol><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a type of adult stem cell made in the bone marrow, which have the ability to produce the different cells found in the blood. Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) is being investigated as a treatment for severe immune mediated diseases, including MS. The aim is to remove the harmful immune cells that attack the brain and spinal cord, and then re-boot the immune system using a person’s own (autologous) stem cells.</p><p>Typically, the person receiving a transplant will be closely observed for about a month in an isolation room whilst receiving antibiotics and transfusions to support them through the procedure. Prior to any treatment decisions being made, our specialist Consultant Haematologists and Neurologists will carefully assess the general health of the person receiving treatment and their ability to tolerate this type of treatment."

    question: "What are the benefits of the treatment?"
    answer: "<p>Clinical trials conducted so far suggest that AHSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability for some people with MS. People with highly active relapsing MS seem to have the best response to the treatment, but results are varied and it may not be effective for all types of MS.</p><p>There have been a number of positive studies reported for AHSCT in people with Relapsing/Remitting MS. The most recent study showed that in 123 people with RRMS, AHSCT was linked to improved disability in 64% of the participants. 80% of participants who were followed for 4 years were relapse-free and 87% were progression-free. Participants reported an improved quality of life and had a reduced number of brain lesions.</p><p>Unfortunately in this study, HSCT was not effective for the 28 participants with SPMS or those who had had RRMS for more than ten years.</p>"

    question: "What are the risks?"
    answer: "<p>AHSCT is an aggressive therapy involving intensive chemotherapy and its short term risks are higher than other MS therapies. Historically the mortality rate associated with HSCT is around 2% although in recent years the data has shown a fall to around 1.3%.</p><p>If you are thinking about undergoing AHSCT, it is important that it is administered in a highly regulated environment.</p><p>Any centre performing transplantations, for MS or any other condition, must have a Joint Accreditation Committee-ISCT & EBMT (JACIE) licence. In order to get a licence, the centre must comply with a huge number of quality standards which are subject to regular inspection and audits.</p><p>As well as having a JACIE licence, in the UK centres are highly regulated by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). There are also long term complications associated with AHSCT and if you are receiving the treatment outside of an accredited centre you may not receive the necessary aftercare.</p><p>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is an accredited centre and meets all the required quality standards. The Trust has an established MS service and is highly regarded in the field of the treatment and research.</p>"

    question: "Does it work for progressive MS?"
    answer: "<p>Results to date show limited evidence for the effectiveness of AHSCT in progressive MS. Some people with progressive MS have seen a stabilisation of their progression, but results are varied, suggesting a response to this treatment is dependent on an individual’s MS.</p><p>The most long term follow up of the use of AHSCT in people with progressive MS involved looking back at the data of 219 people who had received the treatment an average of 6.6 years later. The study showed that almost half of the participants didn’t see any worsening of disability for 5 years after AHSCT.</p>"

    question: "Should I be trying to get AHSCT?"
    answer: "<p>A small number of people have been treated here at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with AHSCT outside of a clinical trial setting. The majority of these are people who have not responded to other treatments, and have an aggressive form of MS, that has a good chance of success with this therapy.</p><p>If you are interested in AHSCT you should speak to your neurologist before contacting the team at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The procedure is high risk so if your neurologist is advising against AHSCT it may be because it is unlikely to be effective in your circumstances based on current research.</p><p>If you are considering a different centre for the treatment, please remember that any centre performing transplantations, for MS or any other condition, must have a Joint Accreditation Committee-ISCT & EBMT (JACIE) licence. If you are referred by your neurologist to receive AHSCT, you should ask them about their experience of the centre and make sure it has the necessary licencing.</p>"

    question: "How long do the effects last?"
    answer: "<p>We need longer duration studies that follow up on people that have received AHSCT in order to determine the long term effects of the treatment.</p><p>As AHSCT is a relatively new treatment in MS, this data doesn’t currently exist. The longest retrospective follow up study was an average of 6.6 years. The study looked at 281 people who had received AHSCT for any type of MS between 1995-2006.</p><p>Better outcomes were seen in younger people, people with relapsing MS and people who had received fewer types of disease-modifying therapy prior to treatment. Improvements in neurological function during the 12 months following transplant were reported in 52% of people with relapsing MS and in 31% of people with progressive MS.</p><p>We need to see the results of properly regulated, long term clinical trials aiming to gather more data and ensure treatments like AHSCT are safe and effective long term before they are made widely available to people with MS or other conditions.</p>"

    question: "How many times do you have to have it?"
    answer: "<p>Currently AHSCT is administered as a one off treatment. We are in need of longer duration studies that follow up on people that have received AHSCT in order to determine the long term effects of the treatment. As AHSCT is a relatively new treatment in MS, this data doesn’t currently exist so we don’t know whether AHSCT would need to be repeated down the line.</p>"

    question: "How much does it cost?"
    answer: "<p>When administered in a clinical trial or through the NHS, AHSCT does not have any financial cost.</p>"

    question: "Where can I get it?"
    answer: "<p>We would strongly encourage people with MS thinking about undergoing AHSCT to discuss this carefully with a specialist healthcare professional such as their neurologist or MS nurse first to weigh up the potential risks and benefits.</p><p>If you are thinking about undergoing AHSCT, it is important that it is administered in a highly regulated environment. The gold standard of this is to be a part of a clinical trial which will be highly regulated and monitor participants long term. <a href='www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00273364' target='_blank'>In the UK there is currently a clinical trial called MIST recruiting participants (www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00273364)</a>.</p><p>If you are thinking about participating in a clinical trial, it’s important to consider and understand exactly what is involved, as well as thinking about the risks and benefits.</p><p>In some carefully assessed cases, including here at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, people have also been treated on the NHS at a JACIE accredited centre outside of a clinical trial.</p><p>Prior to any treatment decisions being made a haematologist and neurologist  will carefully assess the general health of the person receiving the transplant and their ability to tolerate this type of treatment.</p>"

    question: "Where can I get it on the NHS?"
    answer: "<p>he treatment is available here at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College and King’s College. However before contacting these Centres you should discuss the treatment with your own Neurologist of GP in the first instance as the treatment is not suitable for everyone.</p>"

    question: "Who’s eligible to get on an AHSCT clinical trial?"
    answer: "<p>Criteria will vary between trials but the MIST trial that is currently recruiting for people in the UK lists <a href='www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00273364' target='_blank'>a number of inclusion and exclusion criteria on its clinical trial webpage (www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00273364)</a>.</p>"

    question: "Why can’t I get onto a clinical trial?"
    answer: "<p>If you have been excluded from the trial it is likely that you do not meet the study criteria. This could be as a result of a number of factors including your current EDSS score, age, other health problems you face or because based on research to date AHSCT is unlikely to be effective for your MS.</p><p>As it is a high risk procedure, if the benefits are unlikely to outweigh the risks this must be taken into consideration when recruiting participants. As a result, clinical trials are often restrictive due to the criteria that have to be put in place.</p>"

    question: "I can’t get it in the UK so shall I go abroad?"
    answer: "<p>HSCT is an aggressive treatment involving chemotherapy that carries risks and so it is important that it is administered in a highly regulated environment. Any centre performing transplantations, for MS or any other condition, <strong>must have a Joint Accreditation Committee-ISCT & EBMT (JACIE) licence.</strong></p><p>Undergoing this treatment outside an accredited setting, including overseas units, can have additional implications for your health. If your neurologist is advising against AHSCT, it may be because it is unlikely to be effective for you. There are also long-term complications associated with HSCT and if you are receiving the treatment outside of an accredited centre you may not receive the necessary aftercare.</p>"

    question: "Why haven’t I heard about this before?"
    answer: "<p>Until recently there has not been much evidence around the effectiveness and safety of AHSCT in people with MS. Based on previous small pilot studies a number of sites in Europe and the USA set up and recruited for clinical trials. In this setting the studies are more controlled in terms of collecting data and monitoring people. It has only been in the past few months and years that results from some of these studies have been reported.</p><p>Further information about research into Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT)  can be found by visiting: <a href='https://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-research/emerging-areas/stem-cells/AHSCT#risks' target='_blank'>https://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-research/emerging-areas/stem-cells/AHSCT#risks</a></p>"
