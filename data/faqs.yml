    question: "What is Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT)?"
    answer: "<p>The aim of AHSCT is to ‘reset’ the immune system to stop it from attacking the central nervous system. Haematopoietic stem cells are not the type of stem cells that would be expected to change into or regenerate permanently damaged nerves or other parts of the brain and spinal cord.</p> <p>The Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation treatment uses high doses of chemotherapy and antibody treatments, and therefore is more intensive and higher risk than most other MS treatments and involves a number of steps:</p><ol><li>Collection or ‘harvesting’ of stem cells from the bone marrow or blood of the person receiving treatment</li><li>Purification and freezing of the harvested stem cells until they are required</li><li>Administration of chemotherapy to wipe out an individual’s white blood cells </li><li>Infusion of the thawed stem cells to help ‘reset’ the immune system</li></ol><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a type of adult stem cell made in the bone marrow, which have the ability to produce the different cells found in the blood. Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) is being investigated as a treatment for severe immune mediated diseases, including MS. The aim is to remove the harmful immune cells that attack the brain and spinal cord, and then re-boot the immune system using a person’s own (autologous) stem cells.</p><p>Typically, the person receiving a transplant will be closely observed for about a month in an isolation room whilst receiving antibiotics and transfusions to support them through the procedure. Prior to any treatment decisions being made, our specialist Consultant Haematologists and Neurologists will carefully assess the general health of the person receiving treatment and their ability to tolerate this type of treatment."

    question: "What are the benefits of the treatment?"
    answer: "<p><a href='http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2091305' target='_blank'>Clinical trials conducted so far suggest that AHSCT may be able reduce relapses and to stabilise or reduce the level of disability for some people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.</a></p><p>The most recent study showed that in 123 people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, AHSCT was linked to reduction in level of disability in 64% of the people treated. 80% of the people treated who were followed for 4 years had no more relapses and 87% had no worsening of their level of disability. Participants reported an improved quality of life and had a reduced number of new brain lesions on MRI scans</p><p>Unfortunately in this study, HSCT was not effective for the 28 people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or those who had had relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for more than ten years</p>"

    question: "What are the risks?"
    answer: "<p>AHSCT is an aggressive therapy involving intensive chemotherapy and its short term risks are higher than other MS therapies. Historically the mortality rate associated with HSCT is around 2% although in recent years the data has shown a fall to around 1.3%.</p><p>If you are thinking about undergoing AHSCT, it is important that it is administered in a highly regulated environment.</p><p>Any centre performing transplantations, for MS or any other condition, must have a Joint Accreditation Committee-ISCT & EBMT (JACIE) licence. In order to get a licence, the centre must comply with a huge number of quality standards which are subject to regular inspection and audits.</p><p>As well as having a JACIE licence, in the UK centres are highly regulated by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). There are also long term complications associated with AHSCT and if you are receiving the treatment outside of an accredited centre you may not receive the necessary aftercare.</p><p>Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is an accredited centre and meets all the required quality standards. The Trust has an established MS service and is highly regarded in the field of the treatment and research.</p>"

    question: "Does it work for progressive MS?"
    answer: "<p>Unfortunately the trials performed to date show that AHSCT does not work as well in primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. In view of this data, at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust we are only treating people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.</p>"

    question: "Should I be trying to get AHSCT?"
    answer: "<p>There are a number of very effective treatments for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (disease modifying drugs) which reduce relapses (sudden worsening of your neurological symptoms). If you and your neurologist or MS nurse feel that your relapses are controlled on your current treatment, then we would not advise changing to AHSCT. If you do not feel that your relapses are well controlled then it would be important to discuss this with your MS nurse or neurologist, but it may be that another treatment would be preferable.</p><p>If you and your neurologist feel that you have primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis it is also very unlikely that AHSCT will be helpful for you.</p><p>A small number of people have been treated at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with AHSCT outside of a clinical trial setting. These were people with very aggressive relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, who had very frequent and severe relapses which could not be controlled with disease modifying drugs, who we think have the best chance of success with this treatment.</p><p>If you are interested in AHSCT you should speak to your neurologist before contacting the team at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The procedure is high risk so if your neurologist is advising against AHSCT it may be because it is unlikely to be effective in your circumstances based on current research.</p><p>If you are considering a different centre for the treatment, please remember that any centre performing transplantations, for MS or any other condition, must have a Joint Accreditation Committee-ISCT & EBMT (JACIE) licence. If you are referred by your neurologist to receive AHSCT, you should ask them about their experience of the centre and make sure it has the necessary licencing.</p>"

    question: "How long do the effects last?"
    answer: "<p>We need longer duration studies that follow up on people that have received AHSCT in order to determine the long term effects of the treatment. As AHSCT is a new treatment in MS, this data is not yet available. The longest study was for just over 6 years. We need to see the results of properly regulated, long term clinical trials to ensure AHSCT issafe and effective long term before it is made more widely available to people with MS or other conditions.</p>"

    question: "How many times do you have to have it?"
    answer: "<p>Currently AHSCT is administered as a one off treatment. We are in need of longer duration studies that follow up on people that have received AHSCT in order to determine the long term effects of the treatment. As AHSCT is a relatively new treatment in MS, this data doesn’t currently exist so we don’t know whether AHSCT would need to be repeated down the line.</p>"

    question: "How much does it cost?"
    answer: "<p>When administered in a clinical trial or through the NHS, AHSCT does not have any financial cost.</p>"

    question: "Where can I get it?"
    answer: "<p>We would strongly encourage people with MS thinking about undergoing AHSCT to discuss this carefully with a specialist healthcare professional such as their neurologist or MS nurse first to weigh up the potential risks and benefits.</p><p>If you are thinking about undergoing AHSCT, it is important that it is administered in a highly regulated environment. The gold standard of this is to be a part of a clinical trial which will be highly regulated and monitor participants long term. <a href='https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00273364' target='_blank'>In the UK there is currently a clinical trial called MIST recruiting participants</a>.</p><p>If you are thinking about participating in a clinical trial, it’s important to consider and understand exactly what is involved, as well as thinking about the risks and benefits.</p><p>In some carefully assessed cases, including here at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, people have also been treated on the NHS at a JACIE accredited centre outside of a clinical trial.</p><p>Prior to any treatment decisions being made a haematologist and neurologist  will carefully assess the general health of the person receiving the transplant and their ability to tolerate this type of treatment.</p>"

    question: "Where can I get it on the NHS?"
    answer: "<p>The treatment is available here at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College and King’s College. However before contacting these Centres you should discuss the treatment with your own Neurologist of GP in the first instance as the treatment is not suitable for everyone.</p>"

    question: "How does my GP or Neurologist refer to the Sheffield MS service for a consultation?"
    answer: "<p>Please get your GP or Neurologist to send a written referral to:</p><address>Multiple Sclerosis Clinic,<br>Royal Hallamshire Hospital,<br> Glossop Road,<br> Sheffield S10 2JF<br> South Yorkshire<br> England</address>"

    question: "Who’s eligible to get on an AHSCT clinical trial?"
    answer: "<p>Criteria will vary between trials but the MIST trial that is currently recruiting for people in the UK lists <a href='https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00273364' target='_blank'>a number of inclusion and exclusion criteria on its clinical trial webpage</a>.</p>"

    question: "Why can’t I get onto a clinical trial?"
    answer: "<p>If you have been excluded from the trial it is likely that you do not meet the study criteria. This could be as a result of a number of factors including your current EDSS score, age, other health problems you face or because based on research to date AHSCT is unlikely to be effective for your MS.</p><p>As it is a high risk procedure, if the benefits are unlikely to outweigh the risks this must be taken into consideration when recruiting participants. As a result, clinical trials are often restrictive due to the criteria that have to be put in place.</p>"

    question: "I can’t get it in the UK so shall I go abroad?"
    answer: "<p>HSCT is an aggressive treatment involving chemotherapy that carries risks and so it is important that it is administered in a highly regulated environment. <strong>Any centre performing transplantations, for MS or any other condition, must have a Joint Accreditation Committee-ISCT & EBMT (JACIE) licence.</strong></p><p>Undergoing this treatment outside an accredited setting, including overseas units, can have additional implications for your health. If your neurologist is advising against AHSCT, it may be because it is unlikely to be effective for you. There are also long-term complications associated with HSCT and if you are receiving the treatment outside of an accredited centre you may not receive the necessary aftercare.</p>"

    question: "Why haven’t I heard about this before?"
    answer: "<p>Until recently there has not been much evidence around the effectiveness and safety of AHSCT in people with MS. Following some small early studies, hospitals in Europe and USA that offer AHSCT including Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust have monitoring people with MS who have AHSCT. In the last 2 years some of this data have been reported in neurology journals.</p><p>Further information about research into Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) can be found by visiting <a href='https://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-research/emerging-areas/stem-cells/AHSCT#risks' target='_blank'>the MS Society page about AHSCT</a></p>"
