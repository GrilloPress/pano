<p>Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) is being investigated as a treatment for severe immune-mediated diseases particularly MS, here at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
<p>The procedure involves removing the harmful immune system cells that attack the brain and spinal cord in MS, and then uses a personâ€™s own bone marrow stem cells to effectively re-grow these immune system cells. The aim is that re-booting the immune system in this way will prevent further damage in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
