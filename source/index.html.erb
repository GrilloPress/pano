<p>The treatment has been made available through an innovative partnership between our Haematologists and Neurologists.</p>
<p>A small number of patients with relapsing, remitting MS have received the Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) and a clinical research trial is underway to test the long term effects for patients with relapsing/remitting MS.</p>
<p>The procedure involves removing the harmful immune system that attacks the brain and spinal cord in MS, and then uses a person’s own bone marrow stem cells to effectively re-grow the immune system. The aim is that re-booting the immune system in this way will prevent further damage in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>If you are interested in finding out more <a href="#questions">please read our Frequently Asked Questions</a> and further information about research involving this treatment is also available on the <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/" target="_blank">MS Society</a> and <a href="https://www.mstrust.org.uk/" target="_blank">MS Trust</a> websites.</p>
<p>Please note if you wish to discuss whether you are suitable for the treatment you need to speak to your own neurologist or GP FIRST. We cannot consider you for a consultation without a referral from your Neurologist or GP.</p>
