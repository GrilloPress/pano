<p>A small number of patients with relapsing remitting MS have received Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) and a clinical research trial is underway to assess its long term effect in these for patients.</p>
<p>The procedure involves removing the harmful immune cells that attacks the brain and spinal cord in MS, and then uses a person’s own bone marrow stem cells to effectively re-grow the immune system. The aim is that re-booting the immune system in this way will prevent further damage in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
