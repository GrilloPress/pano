<p>If you wish to discuss whether you are suitable for this treatment you need to speak to your own neurologist or GP first. We cannot consider you for a consultation without a referral from them.</p>
<p>A small number of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) have received Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AHSCT) and a clinical research trial is underway to assess its long term effect in such patients.</p>
<p>The procedure involves removing the harmful immune cells that attack the brain and spinal cord, and then uses a personâ€™s own bone marrow stem cells to effectively re-grow the immune system. The aim is that re-booting the immune system in this way will prevent further damage in the brain and spinal cord.</p>
